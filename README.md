Project Name: Real Estate Web Application
Author Name: Kevin Irungu

Description of Project: 
This application is an interactive website designed for the Real Estate industry to enable a given Real Estate Company to display their listings on the website.

The primary focus is to provide a user interface with a search engine for customers to search for listings that meet their specific needs. Property listings are displayed in a customized grid format and the user can click on any to view the property’s description and photographs. This application also provides a “like” feature to save a selected listing to a list of “liked”  properties while the user browses other options on the Real Estate website.

On a separate page, the user can fill a form and leave a review/comment regarding the service provided by the company.

Problem Statement:
There are many real estate websites on the internet but the goal here is to develop something efficient using React and Javascript to enhance already existing features on the internet while doing away with obtrusive and non essential features. The main emphasis is to provide a user-friendly search engine for showing desired results on the GUI, while also providing information regarding the company that would be useful to potential clients.

Solution:
Create an online application/platform that allows users to search for property listings based on their specific needs. 
User stories:
The user can search for a property and filter through the listings based on what they are looking for in a property. (Location, for this particular instance)
The user can click on a listing and view the property’s description and photographs.
The user can click a like button and add a specific listing to a list of “liked” properties while they continue to browse other options on the website.
The user can leave a review/comment on the website regarding the services provided by the company

Link to live site on GitHub:
I had trouble getting the live link to GitHub pages to work. Each time the site only displayed the README.md file.
I have attached below the link to the netlify app.
